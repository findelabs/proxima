# Installation

Proxima is a cloud-ready L7 proxy that can be quickly deployed via docker images pushed regularly to [github](https://github.com/findelabs/proxima).

You can also compile Proxima manually by pulling down the [repo](https://github.com/findelabs/proxima) and running `cargo build --release` within.

Alternatively, you may run `cargo install --git https://github.com/findelabs/proxima.git`.
